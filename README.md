## EcstaticAI: An Intelligent AI-Powered Engine for Financial Research, Strategy, and Insight

EcstaticAI is a research-grade AI-powered financial modeling and analysis engine built entirely in Python. It combines classical financial theory with modern machine learning techniques, automated strategy testing, and language-based interaction. The system connects to live and historical data sources across stocks, cryptocurrencies, and macroeconomic indicators, allowing users to explore ideas, test hypotheses, and simulate strategies through a conversational interface.

The architecture is built in modular layers, each responsible for a different part of the financial workflow. One part generates trading signals using strategies like momentum, mean reversion, and machine learning models trained on rolling features. Another handles performance simulation, recreating how those strategies would have behaved historically while accounting for transaction costs, risk, and capital fluctuations. Allocation tools apply intelligent portfolio construction techniques, including mean-variance optimization and risk parity, to adjust exposures based on market behavior and model confidence.

One of the most useful aspects of EcstaticAI is how it wraps all this quantitative logic inside a chatbot. Users can ask questions like "What is the Sharpe ratio for AAPL?" or "Run a momentum strategy on Apple and backtest it," and the system responds with answers, data, or live simulations. A knowledge retriever searches through embedded PDFs and financial papers to provide deeper context on theory when needed. Whether the task is numerical or conceptual, the chatbot serves as a bridge between financial thinking and automated modeling.

The engine pulls in financial data from a range of sources. Stock prices and technical data come from Yahoo Finance, while economic indicators like GDP and interest rates are pulled directly from the Federal Reserve’s FRED database. Cryptocurrency data is retrieved from Coinbase, enabling analysis of digital assets alongside traditional markets. These sources are processed through standardized interfaces so the data is clean, consistent, and ready to use across different models and workflows.

EcstaticAI is useful for financial analysts, students, engineers, and anyone exploring quantitative finance or AI-assisted research. It helps turn ideas into results without requiring users to switch between multiple platforms or spend time wrangling data into shape. The platform encourages deeper experimentation and faster insight by allowing users to engage directly with complex models and data using simple questions. Whether running a strategy backtest, fetching real-time macro data, or evaluating risk-adjusted returns, the AI handles the heavy lifting so users can stay focused on the decisions that matter most.

This AI Model was made and ran on Python Version 3.13.5
